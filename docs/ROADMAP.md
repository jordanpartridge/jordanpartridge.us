## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

**Gmail API Rate Limits**
- *Risk*: Google API quota exceeded during email synchronization
- *Mitigation*: Implement exponential backoff, batch processing, and queue-based sync

**AI Provider Costs**
- *Risk*: Unexpected high costs from AI content generation
- *Mitigation*: Implement usage limits, cost monitoring, and multiple provider fallbacks

**Security Vulnerabilities**
- *Risk*: New vulnerabilities introduced during rapid development
- *Mitigation*: Automated security scanning in CI/CD, regular dependency updates

### Medium-Risk Items

**Database Migration Complexity**
- *Risk*: Gmail integration migrations may conflict with existing schema
- *Mitigation*: Thorough testing in staging environment, rollback procedures

**Third-Party Integration Breaking Changes**
