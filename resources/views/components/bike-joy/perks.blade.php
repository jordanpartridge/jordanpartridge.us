                          Road bikes are cute, fat bikers embrace the weight and don't try to fight it. It's a
                            different kind of workout, and it's a lot of fun.

                            Biking allows you to clear your mind and look at problems from new perspectives, often
                            leading to creative solutions once you're back at your desk. It's nice to transition from
                            roads to dirt trails one of the joys of fat biking.
