## Description
Improve maintainability by extracting fallback handling into dedicated helper methods.

## Problem
The AIContentService currently duplicates fallback logic across different methods, making maintenance difficult and increasing the chance of inconsistencies.

## Solution
1. Create private helper methods for fallback content:
   - handleGenerationFailure(string $type, Exception $e)
   - getFallbackContent(string $type)
2. Update all methods to use these helpers
3. Enhance logging during fallback

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create private helper methods for fallback content
- Update all content generation methods to use these helpers
- Add tests for fallback functionality
