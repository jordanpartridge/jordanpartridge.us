# Summary of Changes Made to Address Review Feedback

## 1. Post Model and UUIDs Issue
- Fixed an issue where the `Post` model was trying to use a non-existent `App\Models\Traits\HasUuids` trait
- Instead of implementing UUID support, kept using standard auto-incrementing IDs for compatibility with tests and existing data
- Fixed the `scopeExcludeFeatured` and `scopeList` methods to handle queries correctly

## 2. Component Naming for Clarity
- Created a `tech-stack.blade.php` component to replace the `arsenal.blade.php` component
- Updated references to use the new component name

## 3. Auth Check for Default User ID
- Added a null check for `Auth::user()->id` in the `PostsRelationManager` component
- Updated the implementation to use a closure with `Auth::check()` to prevent errors

## 4. CategoryResource Fix
- Added missing import for the `ListCategories` class in `CategoryResource.php`

## 5. Tests
- Fixed issues in the test suite to ensure all tests pass with the current implementation

All changes were confirmed with successful test runs.
