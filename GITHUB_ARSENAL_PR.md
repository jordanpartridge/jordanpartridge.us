# GitHub Arsenal Feature

## Overview
This PR enhances the Software Development page by adding a dedicated "GitHub Arsenal" section that showcases your GitHub repositories in an engaging, visually consistent way.

## Changes
1. Created a new reusable Blade component: `github-repo-card.blade.php` for displaying GitHub repositories
2. Created a new Blade component: `github-arsenal.blade.php` for the repository showcase section
3. Updated the software-development index page to include the new GitHub Arsenal section
4. Maintained consistent visual styling with the existing site design

## Benefits
- Provides concrete examples of your work rather than just listing technologies
- Creates a direct connection to your GitHub profile for portfolio review
- Maintains the military theme with the "Arsenal" concept while adding real substance
- Enhances credibility by showing actual code projects

## How to Test
1. View the Software Development page
2. Scroll down past the Technical Arsenal section to see the GitHub Arsenal section
3. Verify the repository cards display correctly with proper styling
4. Test that the links point to the correct GitHub repositories

## Screenshots
(Screenshots would normally be included here in an actual PR)

## Next Steps
- Connect to the GitHub API to dynamically pull repository data
- Allow filtering by technology or sorting by stars/forks
- Add a "Featured Repository" section on the homepage

This implementation addresses the generic "Arsenal" section by providing a showcase of real repositories rather than just technology listings.
